                <h2><span class="num">1</span> Data Genesis</h2>
                <p>The foundation of CharityAI is its strictly curated dataset, comprising <strong>264 high-impact
                        nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)</strong>. We believe that the integrity of a recommendation
                    engine is directly proportional to the quality of its input. Therefore, our data genesis protocol
                    follows a multi-tier ingestion pipeline designed to filter out ambiguity and focus exclusively on
                    high-performance entities.</p>

                <p>Each entry in the `data.js` master file has been primary-sourced from verified global disclosure
                    portals. This includes cross-referencing IRS Form 990 data for US-based organizations, UK Charity
                    Commission filings, and local regulatory certifications across India, Kenya, South Africa, and
                    beyond.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Direct Source Verification Pillar:</strong>
                    <p style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:0; font-size:15px;">Unlike standard scrapers, our engine
                        validates the <strong>Unique Identification Number (UIN)</strong> for every charity before
                        permanent inclusion. If a charity's registration status is not active or in good standing with
                        its respective national regulator, it is automatically purged from the recommendation pool.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We analyze historical reputation back to 2022, ensuring that the charities presented are not merely
                    one-year wonders but established pillars of the philanthropic community with a sustainable
                    trajectory.</p>

                <h2><span class="num">2</span> The Cortex Engine v4.2</h2>
                <p>The "Cortex Engine" is our proprietary matching protocol. It moves beyond simple keyword filtering to
                    implement a **multi-vector semantic analysis**. When a user selects a cause—say, "Education &
                    Literacy" in "Kenya"—the engine doesn't just look for those strings; it evaluates the charity
                    against the user's donor persona.</p>

                <p>The weighting algorithm is designed to prioritize <strong>dollar-for-dollar efficacy</strong>. We
                    believe that a donor's most important metric is how much of their contribution reaches the actual
                    beneficiary. Therefore, the engine applies a heavy scalar to the Program Expense Ratio.</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    /**
                    * Cortex Protocol v4.2 Weighting Matrix
                    * Goal: Maximize realistic impact & mission alignment
                    */

                    function calculateProtocolScore(donorState, charity) {
                    // 1. Mission Convergence (Max +25 points)
                    let score = semanticMap(donorState.cause, charity.primary_cause);

                    // 2. Geographic Proximity (Max +25 points)
                    if (charity.country === donorState.location) score += 25;
                    else if (charity.operating_regions.includes(donorState.location)) score += 15;

                    // 3. Efficiency Multiplier (Max +10 points)
                    // Weighted bonus for program ratios exceeding 85%
                    const efficiency = charity.program_expense_ratio;
                    if (efficiency > 0.85) score += (efficiency - 0.85) * 66.7;

                    // 4. Trust Vector Scalar (Max +10 points)
                    const trust = charity.trust_score;
                    if (trust > 90) score += (trust - 90);

                    return clamp(score, 10, 99);
                    }
                </div>

                <p>This protocol ensures that small, high-efficiency local organizations have the opportunity to outrank
                    massive global charities that may have higher overheads but lower direct impact ratios.</p>

                <p>For a charity to be categorized as "Operating in Kenya," our protocol requires proof of established
                    infrastructure, local staffing, and measurable regional impact reports within the last 18 months.
                    This prevents "parachute philanthropy" and ensures that recommended charities have deep, sustainable
                    roots in their target communities.</p>

                <p>Our "AI Intelligence" tab is powered by what we call <strong>Forensic Financial Modeling</strong>. We
                    don't just display the revenue; we break it down to see how money moves through the organization. We
                    analyze three critical ratios:</p>

                <ol style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 32px;">
                    <li><strong>Program Expense Ratio:</strong> The lifeblood of the charity. We look for >80% as the
                        "Gold Standard."</li>
                    <li><strong>Administrative Overhead:</strong> We analyze executive compensation and internal
                        logistics costs to ensure they stay within ethical bounds relative to the sector.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundraising Efficiency:</strong> We measure how much it costs the charity to raise $1.
                        High-efficiency charities keep this below $0.15.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This data is not static. Our `data.js` architecture is designed to be updated per fiscal year,
                    currently reflecting the most audited data from late 2024 and early 2025. When you see a
                    "Transparency Score" of 100, it means that organization has provided full, audited visibility into
                    all three of these ratios.</p>

                <p>Our engine applies a "Historical Consistency" modifier. Organizations that have maintained a high
                    trust score for more than 5 consecutive years receive a visibility priority in our recommendation
                    cycle. This rewards long-term operational integrity and provides donors with peace of mind.</p>
